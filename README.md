Grunt w/ CoffeeScript and Ember Tools
=======

Look at the grunt file for examples of setting stuff up.

# Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fivetanley/coffee-ember-tools-example.git
cd coffee-ember-tools-example
npm install -g grunt-cli # (if you don't already have it)
npm install -g ember-tools # (if you don't already have it)
npm install
grunt
```

# Usage

Running `grunt` will watch your CoffeeScript files for changes, compiling them,
and triggering an ember-tools build as necessary. Note: only the `coffee`
directory is watched for changes.
